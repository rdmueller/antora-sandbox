== Antora Sandbox

This is just a simple sandbox to play around with antora.

Start it with gitpod https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/rdmueller/antora-sandbox and you will get a web based VS Code where antora is already installed and the initial playbook is launched in the browser.

=== Some thoughts

* used docToolchain to get some local templates setup:
** ./dtcw downloadTemplate
* read a bit further to get tabs isntalled without creating my own theme: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-tabs/blob/main/docs/use-with-antora.adoc#using-the-supplemental-ui[using the supplemental ui]
