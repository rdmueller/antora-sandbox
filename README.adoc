== Antora Sandbox

This is just a simple sandbox to play around with antora.

Start it with gitpod https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/rdmueller/antora-sandbox and you will get a web based VS Code where antora is already installed and the initial playbook is launched in the browser.

A preview is available here: https://rdmueller.github.io/antora-sandbox/

=== Some thoughts

* used docToolchain to get some local templates setup:
+
[source,bash]
----
./dtcw downloadTemplate
----

* read a bit further to get tabs installed without creating my own theme: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-tabs/blob/main/docs/use-with-antora.adoc#using-the-supplemental-ui[using the supplemental ui]

* top menu navigation has been modified through a partial ui configured in paybook: https://github.com/rdmueller/antora-sandbox/blob/main/antora-playbook.yml#L36

* partial ui could also be configured in a folder: https://github.com/ahus1/antora-extensions-demo/tree/main/playbook/supplemental_ui/partials
